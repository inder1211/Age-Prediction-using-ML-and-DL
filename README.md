# Age-Prediction-using-ML-and-DL
The aims of this project is to compare and analyze the performance of ML and DL algorithms for  human age prediction. 
The project aims to evaluate the accuracy and computational efficiency of 
different ML and DL techniques, such as SVM, NB, Bernoulli NB, DT, ANN and CNN for age 
prediction from facial images. The project also aims to investigate the impact of different factors 
on age prediction performance, such as dataset size, feature selection, and model complexity. 
Overall, the project aims to provide insights into the strengths and limitations of different ML and 
DL approaches for age prediction, and to guide the selection of appropriate methods for practical 
applications in various domains.
